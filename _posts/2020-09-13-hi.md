This is my first blog post to introduce you my new blog.

After various of blog try I'm here.

#### Why I created a new blog?

Maybe some of you know, I write in English and Turkish. I was sharing English posts under my own blog. For Turkish posts I was using Medium platform.

The first thing that I decide, I'll not continue to write in Turkish and I'll only publish posts under my own blog. 

The second is I was using different themes, I decided to design my blog and not to use themes.

The third one is I'll share a road map with you to what I'm going to write about. (I'll add link soon.) 
I was writing so long articles and also doing demos. Instead of doing demos, I'll share GitHub repositories and If one of my blog post is going to be a long(will describe it) I'll seperate that topic to part by part.

My blog is not fully ready but I'll continue to write and improve this blog. We can think that September and October 2020 is open beta of my blog.

I'll not just share technical blog posts, I'll also start to write about my thoughts.

I'll share about what I'm reading, watching etc.

I'll refactor and publish my old blog posts very soon.

This is kind of TO-DO and NOT-TO-DO list for me right now.

I can improve this but for now thats what going to happen.

Cheers!
