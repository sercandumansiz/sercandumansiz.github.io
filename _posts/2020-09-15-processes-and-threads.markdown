# Process

Process is a running instance of a program. Which means that a code that we wrote is executed and has a store on memory is a process.

# Thread
Process might have multiple threads. 
Thread is the unique context of process.

In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.

# Address space

Address space is available **memory** for the process and this space assigns by the operating system to user.

Address space can be logical(virtual) and physical. If the address space is generated by CPU it's a virtual adress space. If the address space on the pyscial memory it is physical memory adress space.
