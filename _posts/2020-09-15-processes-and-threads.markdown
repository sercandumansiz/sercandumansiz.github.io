# Process

Process is a running instance of a program. Which means that a code that we wrote is executed and has a store on memory is a process.

# Thread

Process might have multiple threads. In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. (thread part will be update by my own words.) [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))
