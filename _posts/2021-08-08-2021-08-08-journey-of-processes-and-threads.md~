//TODO:// add quote summary of 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics

I'm mentioning this Nobel Prize in Physics 1956 because;

Firstly, I wanted to show you who's the invetors of transistors.

Secondly 1956 is important because after 2 years of discovering transistor effect, In 1958 two engineers Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invented integrated circuits.
